Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort Comparison:

1. Bubble Sort will swap the adjacent only if its smaller and check the next whether its 
smaller or not if not then it will leave and the sorting will be done.

2. Insertion Sort will keeps checking the left side of the element only swap it if the 
number is small otherwise it will remain the same, it will keep repeating the same step 
until the elements are sorted.

Comparison: 
1. Insertion sort is faster than the Bubble Sort.
2. Effectively for the large number of array sorting will be done quickly compared to Bubble Sort.

Example: 

In milliseconds, Insertion Sort taking 0.2296ms but the Bubble Sort taking 0.3331ms. 
So Comparatively, Insertion sort is taking less time to do the sorting than Bubble Sort.
